- No flashy effects — clean and modern
- Ensure the video loops seamlessly (Frame 10 fades into Frame 1)
- Use consistent text positioning throughout
- The video will play on a monitor above a live demo, so Frame 6 and Frame 9 should clearly point downward to draw attention to the demo below

**Total runtime:** Exactly 60 seconds
**Format:** MP4, seamless loop
**Audio:** None (silent)
