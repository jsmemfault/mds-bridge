## DESIGN NOTES

### Color Palette
- Nordic blue (#00A9CE) as primary accent
- Memfault green (#00D26A) for success states
- Dark background (#1a1a2e or similar) for contrast
- White/light gray text

### Typography
- Clean sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- Large, readable from 10+ feet away
- High contrast for visibility in booth lighting

### Animation Style
- Smooth, confident transitions
- No flashy effects — professional and modern
- 0.3-0.5s transitions between elements
- Subtle motion keeps it alive without being distracting

### Loop Seamlessness
- Frame 8 fades to match Frame 1 exactly
- No jarring cut — should feel continuous
- Consider a 0.5s crossfade at loop point
