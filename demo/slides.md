|     Below is the UART console of an nRF54LM20-DK,    |
|         running a USB HID example app with           |
|       Memfault integrated and configured to          |
|       exfiltrate diagnostic data via custom          |
|                   HID reports.                       |

|          As it resets, you may observe               |
|      heartbeat metric data begin streaming           |
|      through the connected USB HID gateway           |
|              console to the left.                    |

|   Pressing one of the user buttons will trigger a    |

|       Memfault captures the coredump and             |
|      begins streaming these new diagnostic           |
